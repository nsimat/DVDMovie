# DVDMovie
This project is a learning journey to blend the power of Angular 12 and .NET Core for creating interactive and real-world applications that can easily communicate the frontend 
and the backend. My goal is to create a strong Angular UI shopping application for DVD movies and .NET Core 5 Web Services for querying data in a SQL Server 2019 database. 
The first step will be to create the Data models for our project. Then,I will move on to create the CRUD methods using Entity Framework Core 5 and ASP.NET Core Web API.

Finally, I will structure the Angular frontend application with routing, build a pipeline, and complete the UI to get a nice Angular UI store with a shopping cart.

Let's take our journey to become an established and confident full-stack developer by building projects with Angular and ASP.NET Core.
